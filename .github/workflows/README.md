- `contents: read` - To read repository contents for analysis

## Customization

### Adding New Triggers
To add new triggers, modify the `on` section of the workflow:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review, synchronize, closed]
```

### Modifying Notifications
To change notification content, edit the `body` field in the `createComment` calls.

### Adding New Labels
To add new automatic labels, modify the label detection logic in `pr-management.yml`.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running
- Check that the workflow files are in the `.github/workflows/` directory
- Verify the workflow syntax is valid YAML
- Ensure the repository has GitHub Actions enabled

### Notifications Not Working
- Verify @romkey has access to the repository
- Check that the workflow has the necessary permissions
- Review the workflow logs for any errors

### Permission Issues
If workflows fail due to permissions, ensure the repository settings allow:
- GitHub Actions to read and write repository contents
- Workflows to create comments and manage issues/PRs

## Maintenance

These workflows are designed to be low-maintenance and self-contained. They use standard GitHub Actions and don't require external dependencies.

To update workflows:
1. Modify the workflow files in this directory
2. Commit and push changes
3. The new workflows will be automatically available for future PRs
